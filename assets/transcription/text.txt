China last spring we had a regarding this video we had a change regarding our quotation file just quickly share just explain yes it's available today quotation earlier when we create the quotation so we were getting test 5 so for running will get 5 priority based on this price ok so we had a requirement saying if at all there is any quality based on publish publish application status so we have to market if the ability is if it is not available so you see this Elite right this is specifically for a publishing using this publishing evaluate if we have this discontinue so for those ideas I mean for those records so we have to market as I said we should not consider it for priority change we have made change a we have done it in quotation but this affects our edif floor so wherein when you run Edi but Edi perspective we have to consider only 11 or friday listing ok we have one special case in this case we have here but in case also here we have this for the to this three records for two different ispl ok consider the last two records before same I spin from two vendors ok if you see here the first record itself in next is L1 so from quotation we are just getting this just marking at as lz and but when you push to EDI Edi will get the same data and it is better to whatever the first record we are getting just a processing that so earlier we used to get this process for 63.11 so that is but that is we should not opposite small change required here so instead of considering gadget so you just need to get the next album data so for that we have already I just stand what exactly it is it also I'll show you test also actually this everything the sorting and everything is happening in investment services is a method for filter price details so we are calling this method once the data is available so here if you see we are checking for weather sorting it different it is quite different change here while sorting this is the sorting logic for isps ok so here if you see this validate availability based on this just pushing it whichever way if you are getting that here I am just pushing else it to the next position I am just bring up the 11 back to the first position based on the sorting technique is there is a method here this method will return best I have told you this publish values so if there has been having this publish value so we are just market as a l z based on the quantity also the bridges market is sorting at based on this case so the data after change in before application apply this change so it was taking this 63.81 and 885 you see here right generated for the same this is the same to experience the price which we are passive now using 60 78.53 to ADI sister sorting change the changes the last spring data so we had not planned for anything from India so the small you can do at your end I think I get the same change and you can just also result of small generator if you have anything I can just help your price under requirement contested so it's already there so you can test it and just certify has been done right so it's already as well as on production refined it also it tested from his side but now you test on q and post it on production you have questions to development you are able to restart the ideal services whatever we are doing just asking after this change are you able to restart the ideal services or do you delete any help regarding that from Udaipur to have to restart that service service you can just be confirmed the services started is there any precautions to take before start then we start increasing numbers and then one more thing for this idiot to pick up the data right so we touch to come from Bibliography table so make sure it is updating from whatever Kunal explain so it is updating it is updating table so if it is not updating so the updating of the other things that has to be identical and same same would be there traffic and initiation of the things because you know production if you see Amazon is the production environment only so already always picked up the data from the production environment only music on the development server to create a replica type of thing and just check anything from development of QA to Amazon for testing also that is clear from production data itself and try to Trigger them and just see what is the latest data which is reflected on the Amazon panel if you keep the sample size less than you will be able to search on the Amazon panel and you will be able to finally also and there are there are use cases Puja which should be aware of for example if you push the price which is more than 20% system will not accept that they will get for rejected so the best price also has to be absolutely correct on which date will be pushing the data connect ok needs to be checked right so that was the change that we were discussing in yesterday called currency thing that you are asking from Kunal is it done or how is it possible so there is an error on the wildlife right right to open box one is the quotation going in progress which we cannot reproduce on key Way Or production it comes like one of one or two months and similarly is for this thing can you speaking of currency in spite of hard coating like we have hard coded that value should not pick up the currency so it could be a reason that data inconsistency from the vendor is coming and then something is getting broken for one or two records but 9% it is picking up correctly but that is again not reproducible Delta so if we tried with the same file and same feed ingestion also one to reproduce it it cannot be reproduce it cannot be troubleshooted so the running team has to take Pooja your team has to check it whenever it appears the see the log immediately within a day and see why it has happened and if you are able to trace it then ok one of scenario it is not coming like frequently but it is a critical one it is not a non critical thinking is getting ok ok I have one more questions the file which you have just showed us is it the updated quotation on the previous old version from quotation change this is this is the same in quotation part you still see the same thing I'm not saying this you should see it after the change but only in the area we are not considering this one we are considering L1 I have written 15 in the packet back right but in our bracket we have not updated any ticket back charges I love your question was related to new request configure not the master Masters ok call to you because when you will configure that thing won't work right so we have to write at least one or 15 or 10 anything please keep a type of this set column it should not be 15 it will not be there because Pooja will not disturb the I believe Pooja will not disturb the production [Unintelligible audio] [Unintelligible audio]
